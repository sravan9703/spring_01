project success
= process * tools * techology  * culture.

technology is getting commoditized.
















summarize.
1. spring is product and opinionated product.
2. three tier architecture, spring is used today
in service and dao, presentation layer has javascript.
3. you will get many api claiming advantages ...
we need tradeoff.

in terms of coding. what is most important thing spring
tells.

1. inversion of control.
spring hey create objects and give to me.
2. dependancy injection.
spring is telling i will give you the object locally.
if you want you increase the scope by storing it
in a non local reference.









code
configuration file 
1. is it our own
we can show creativity
2. it is used by the framework  ( restrictions)
what you write inside is decided by the framework
3. filename.
if you are writing filename anywehre in code.
that means file name can be anything.



maven 
1. folder structure decided by maven, depending
on the category of the maven project you choose
(opinionated) with lot of customizations.

2. we have to package our code, deploy our code.
maven gives you options for doing this.

3.to compile code we may use other librarymaven 
gives us mechanism to include libraries (jar files
of other people)

4. today world not using maven is not acceptable.
maven can download libraries from net and also
try to store it company level respositories or a system 



we have too many options to configure in maven.
too many, most common reason why  maven will not work



c:\users\xx folder
xx folder username.

xx folder there will be another folder called .m2.

.m2 there is a folder called repositories, this is folder
where downloaded libraries are stored.

in .m2 folder we need a file called settings.xmlwhich needs to configured in a company specific way to download
the lilbraries required.




miracle question , which library to download
answer nobody can tell us except the framework
or the cousins provided the framework is old.

maven
1. no errors in maven project, it is showing jdk1.8
2. pom.xml file.
we have some add dependancies

depedancy is standardized mechansim available in
maven to include any kind of libraries.

dependancies tag
dependancy
version
groupid
artififact id 
from this, maven will start downloading the jar files.




figuring out what entries to put in maven.xml file
for libraries, .. patience ...










	<dependency>
  		<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
  		<artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
  		<version>5.0.7.RELEASE</version>
  	</dependency>


this line we wrote in our pom.xml file.
i cannot show any creativity on groupid
artificatid or version,  becuase those details
are matched with are repository to pick appro.. libraries.

we want to work on web serivces
i may need another set of jar files it is left to the framework
guys whether they want to bundle the entire libraries
in one or set of things, spring framework does it as set of
things and not as a single library.

there will tonnes of annotation that comes into usage.
if we byheart the out of ram ... come.

so let us you see X annotation ?




@Component.
who gave it
spring guys

what is benefit they have promised
they have told if you use annotation I will create
the object of the class.

when will they give benefit
if we give our classname to spring framework.

at what leve should i use the annotation
Class level.


@componentScan
who gave it, spring gusy

what does it do?
in java project there could be multipe packages.
looking in all packages , and each class for annotations
that spring has given is tedious
spring wants to narrow down the searh to some packages
you mention.
@componentScan("hey spring search only in these packges")

class A
{

public void f1()
{
	sysout("bl");
}


}

A obj1 = ?
obj1.f1();
security began
bl
security end.


1.@componentScan  -- you are telling spring to look
packages which is using the @component anntoation.

2. @Component  -- spirng hey create the object.

@autowired-- we are telling spring hey two objects
x and y.  x needs to vice versa.

at the place where you need the object in a function
use @autowired.

for example x needs y objectx, then @autowired is used
in some function of x.

we want ot create the object of the class and tell
spring hey you must use it for wiring. 
we write a function that returns an object and use
an annotation called @Bean on top of the function.












6 class file

4 classes
2 interfaces.

eclipse

1. use it and then create rather create it and then think where to use it


1. main function.
2 Presentaton class
3. create a presentation function.
4. inside presnetation function start using service object
5. create  a service class...


1. 3 tier using spring.
2. web technology and web services.
3. come with your own two examples...





convention

1. if you are uisng @Bean obvioiusly on a function
the fucntion should return some object.

2. if we are uisng @autowired, function should
take object as input argument .

java bean
java class, with setters and getterrs following
the naming convention and it is important
no argument constructor in teh class.

POJO-- pure old java object.

@component is not only annotation that helps you
in creating objects thre are speicalized ones
for example

@Repository
@service
@Controller
@RestController.
...





web application.

REST... http 
1. we are going to use http protocol.
2. what do you mean by event?

2.1 notification mechanism when state changes.
2.2 event is one way communication, event listener
cannot talk back.

web application
get
post
request modees ie client to server.
get body is empty
post body can have content.

we need very high levels of abstractions in any
web application we are responding to events.
event handling functions always return void.












hope the mind map on the spring is overview.













web services.
0. both json and http are great becuase they are standards
1.we have a service layer function.
2. we want to enable this function should be called
thru http protocol.
3. to call a function client needs input paramter and data type and output paramter and data type.
4. we are telling presentation can be built in any technology
5. so syntax for the same data type can change in servcie layer as well as presenation layer.. 
6. so we need some neutral format to represent variables
(dataype + values) = that format is json
7. in short what the client does is the following.

1. write the calling function logic using an ip address.
some name and mode of request., passing
paramters in json format. client can be helped by
using some framework.









code a web service (REST), 


1. you have a class, tell spring hey look this class
object you must create yourself and you should take
responsiblity of converting respones to json and json
data to native things.
@RestController.


2. we write a function. x

    Z  x( Y temp)
we have to first decide when x be called.
1. string to identify
2. mode of request.
we are telling if somebody comes with get mode of request and a string called "callthis" under that circumstance
call my function x.
3. we see an input argument called Y.
4. this Y will have to come thru three ways.
4.1 query parameter     url?x=3
4.2  url/name/3  -- path variable.
4.3 object in request body, provided method is post.
